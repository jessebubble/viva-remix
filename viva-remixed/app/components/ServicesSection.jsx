          To facilitate effective communication, each client is assigned a key account manager who acts as a liaison between the client and the development team.
          This helps manage client expectations and allows the development team to focus on their work, which includes exploring open source projects for reusable code

          Our account managers are trained to respond to client emails several days after the initial email, typically after 9pm.
