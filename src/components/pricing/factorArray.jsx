        description: "Our philosophy when it comes to technical implementation is based on simplicity and minimalism. We avoid reinventing the wheel by using service providers to implement certain functionalities (i.e. authentication). We also do not use a service if it's not needed, making sure to save subscription costs. Building in blocks allows us to avoid unnecessary complexity and keep your project simple.",

        description: "We're usually able to provide a fixed price and time estimate if we're able to work with you to formulate all the requirements of your project. However, this is not always the case. In these instances, we would either offer a research phase to nail the requirements or an ongoing agreement with daily rate. The rate will depend on the scope of your project and the number of custom blocks we need to create for your website.",

However, it does offer a free trial period during which you can set up and explore the platform without incurring any charges.
