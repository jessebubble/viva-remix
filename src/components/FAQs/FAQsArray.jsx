      question: "How much does a website cost to build from scratch?",
      answer: "The answer is simple: it depends. We're usually able to provide a fixed price and time estimate if we're able to work with you to formulate all the requirements of your project. However, this is not always the case. In these instances, we would either offer a research phase to nail the requirements or an ongoing agreement with daily rate. The rate will depend on the scope of your project and the number of custom blocks we need to create for your website.",
